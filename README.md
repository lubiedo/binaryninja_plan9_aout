# 9 a.out BinaryView

Binary Ninja Plugin for disassembling a.out binaries. Currently only sort-of works for x86_64 and arm.

###Â TODO:
- [x] Correct segmentation of binary.
- [x] Finding Strings in binary and correct loading in binja.
- [x] Fix up function names through either loading of syscalls or through symbols.
- [ ] Potential loading of symbols.
- [ ] Get even remotely close to acid
